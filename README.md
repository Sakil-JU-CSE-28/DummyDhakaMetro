It's an android application which will performe some basic but useful task when all station of dhaka-metro will be opened.
By using this app one can find useful information about each of the station of dhaka metro rail. The most attractive feature
of the app is - 

### List of station to achive Shortest time to reach from source station to destination station
### List of station to achive Minimum cost to reach from source station to destination station

Here i assume that all station of dhaka metro are working and use some famous data structure and algorithm to solve this 
problem. I developed the appliction in android studio with java programming language.
